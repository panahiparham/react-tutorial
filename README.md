# Creating Webpages with React.js

hiii i'm going create a small resume website and explain what i do at each step.

<br />

Each section is a branch in this repo so you can follow step by step.


<br />

The code of each section is in the files in the corresponding branch. for example in the "Adding-HTML" secion, all the explanations are in the README.md of Adding-HTML branch and the code written in the section is also in the repo in the same branch.


<br />

## Contents

* step 1 . Project-setup
* step 2 . Adding-HTML
* step 3 . Adding-components
* step 4 . Adding-CSS
* step 5 . Adding-Scrolling
* step 6 . Deployment

For each section there is a branch created in this repo, you can head into "Project-Setup" branch to get started :)

<br />

I hope i can explain the process clearly and be helpful :)

<br />

Of course if any section is vague or unclear make sure to ask me. I hope you enjoy :)

<br />

The final version of our site is live at [This Page](https://panahiparham.github.io/react-tutorial/) .
